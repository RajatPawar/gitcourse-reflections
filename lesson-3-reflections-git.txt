I would want to use a remote repository if there are multiple people working on the same thing or if I am using multiple devices to work
on the same project. Therein lies the usefulness of GitHub - it's accessibility.
Someone else may have updated something else on the website that you might not want to yet get in your local repo.
Branch is a different line of a project that wants to develop indivisually on one aspect and can be merged back with it's main line.
Clone is a simple copy of a repository, local or remote from GitHub or another computer.
Fork is a copy of a remote repository from GitHub, onto GitHub that one might want to develop his or own features onto it. It's
independant of the original author.
The benefit of having origin/master on your local repository is if you are not connected, you still know the last known state of the
remote and don't have to constantly pull data for various operations.
Collaborating without Git would be a PITA. There would be no secure production ready code, reviewing would be difficult and
redundancy would be too much. Too many versions would be created. Git is good, but it's a bit complex and has a bit of a
learning curve. Otherwise, this is brilliant!
Using separate branches helps us to keep a 'master' - production ready line. There is a lot of tinkering that is possible
when we use a different branch without even having to worry about breaking the setup code that works. On the other hand,
it increases complexity. But it's better.
